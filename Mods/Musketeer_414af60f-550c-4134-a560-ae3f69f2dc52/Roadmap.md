Fixes:
- Font color for mastery texts (Teal text on white background -> very bad contrast and thus hard readability)
- Covering Fire and Final Act not usable when muted? Inconsistent...
- Increase radius of rifle fire SFX?
- Blunderbuss fire surface is finnicky to use...

- Doubled Edged Sword
    Deal 15% bonus damage against targets that have more HP than you. Receive 10% more damage from targets with less HP than you. (Kinda boring, needs more flavour)
- The Three Musketeers
    [1] restores <font color='#00EFFF'>1 Ammunition</font> to all members of your party whenever you restore at least <font color='#00EFFF'>1 Ammunition</font> yourself. (<font color='#00EFFF'>1 Ammunition</font> restored by [1] or other Talents excluded)<br>Additionally provides +2 to both the Ranged and the Single-Handed Combat Ability, but decreases your Constitution by 2 points and your Warfare Skill by 1 point. All effects of this talent are temporarily disabled while there are more than three members in the current party. (NEEDS TO BE REWORKED)
